        <p><span class="first-letter">I</span> am in the Great Sahara Desert. I have arrived in Morocco after my long stay in Jordan. Jordan is a classic country. The more you stay,
        the more it feels like home. The people, the food, the culture all creates a bond which feels like a call from the ancient times, a call of love which is echoeing through centuries.</p>
        <p>Right now i am in Sahara Dessert. streams of questions crossing my mind</p>
        <p>"How did i get here?"</p>
        <p>"Life is such a precious gift, isn't it?"</p>
        <p>"Would i ever be able to express how grateful i feel to GOD for this life!"</p>

        <p>It has been a great journey. I am not quite sure if it is a lonely one. To be honest, i never felt lonely since i found GOD and all the truth. The Divine knowledge and laws which governs this universe. It has been a great learning journey. All praise is due to GOD. As long as you know that HE WHO created you is taking care of you in every breath and listens to your hearts whispers, you are in good heands. better start celebrating cz HE is the MOST MERCIFUL and you are in great hands.</p>

               <h1>"Your feet will always take you where your heart is"</h1></div>

        <p>We are all summoning life force for the greater good of this planet. As our time is allocated by THE LORD, it is important to fulfill our mission, the mission we have been created for. Each of us has unique mission. The mission only gets revealed when you ask questions and be in solitude. Because in solitude you are never alone, rather you are in HIS great company. That's when the secrets are revealed to your heart.</p>

        </div>

        <p>Let me tell you one thing, when your own mission finds you... i can assure you nobody will understand you except for few. So, always look for people who make an 'effort' to understand you. Those are the ones who are real treasures in your life. Sometimes it is not easy or available to find those kind of brave golden hearted souls. Till then you can look back to your ancestors who have been successful. They will be a great companion for you. Though they died, they didn't stay dead. Their intelligence and lion hearts echoed through the existence of time.</p>
